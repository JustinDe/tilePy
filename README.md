#tilePy

Draw Tile Based Maps in ASCII, assign a texture to the ascii character, define your map size and this map parser will do the rest. 

So far this has only been a VERY sloppy proof of concept

Requirements:
* Python 2.7.*
* PyGame

TODO:
* Clean Up Code
* Define Default Tile
* Validate map size
